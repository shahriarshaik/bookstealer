# bookstealer

Description: 

This is a python file that basically steals books. 

I wrote this code back in 2020 when i was 17. 

This code uses the Norwegian unibok app for windows, where it goes inn and 
screenshots and saves every page on the book

It uses the native windows screenshot app to take the screenshots

After you are done you will have a folder full of all of the books pages
which you can put togather to a book by "printing" it as a pdf.

example of it running:

Using this code:

you have to make some changes for it to work with your set-up

the resolution on the screenshot are based on the resolution on your monitor
the resolution i used for my books were 4k

you don't need a 4k monitor to run 4k on the display, you could use DSR or 
similar technologies

video of 4k on 1080p monitor:

you proboably have to change some of the code (spefically the mouse locations) 
to fit your screen
