# bookstealer
This is a python file that basically steals books. 

I wrote this code back in 2020 when i was 17. 

This code uses the Norwegian unibok app for windows, where it goes inn and screenshots and saves every page on the book

It uses the native windows screenshot app to take the screenshots

after you are done you will have a folder full of all of the books pages
